# Snake

I always enjoyed Snake, so this repo is my implementation of the classical Snake game on a terminal using Python.

The top level module is `main.py`. Executing this file from a terminal will start the game.
Use arrow keys to move the snake, Q to quit and P to pause. Going out of bounds simply loops you back to the other side.

Developed on and tested in Ubuntu 22. This won't work on Windows due to the platform-dependent Curses library used for the terminal UI.
